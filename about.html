            I'm Agbo Agnes from Benue state, a student of federal university of technology Minna, a final 
                            year student of the department of Library and information technology. I'm currently
                            learning mobile app development with Stutern with the help of the scholarship 
                            from Ingressive4good. My journey into tech has been a rough one where as it took me 
                            time before i could decide what aspect i really want but even with that, my passion for 
                            tech has never changed and that has brought me to the point where i am today.
